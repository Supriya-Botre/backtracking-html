        <h1>Backtracking</h1>
        <p>Copyright Â©2002 by David</p>

       <p> Backtracking is the form of <i>recursion.</i></p>

<p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you
make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice
you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence
of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.
</p>

<p> Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves,
   though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning
   with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
   </p>
   <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most
      recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice
      that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no
      good leaves to be found.</p>
<p>This needs an example</p>
<center><img src="./backtrack.png"></center>
<ol>
    <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
    <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
    <li>. C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
    <li> At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
    <li>. D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
    <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
    <li> At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
    <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
    <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices
   we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us
   what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree
   searching.)

<h2>Backtracking Algorithm</h2>
<p>A backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force approach for finding the desired output.</p>

    #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        static int total_nodes;
        void printValues(int A[], int size){
           for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
              printf("%*d", 5, A[i]);
           }
           printf("
        ");
        }
        void subset_sum(int s[], int t[], int s_size, int t_size, int sum, int ite, int const target_sum){
           total_nodes++;
           if (target_sum == sum) {
              printValues(t, t_size);
              subset_sum(s, t, s_size, t_size - 1, sum - s[ite], ite + 1, target_sum);
              return;
           }
           else {
              for (int i = ite; i < s_size; i++) {
                 t[t_size] = s[i];
                 subset_sum(s, t, s_size, t_size + 1, sum + s[i], i + 1, target_sum);
              }
           }
        }
       
        int main(){
           int set[] = { 5, 6, 12 , 54, 2 , 20 , 15 };
           int size = sizeof(set) / sizeof(set[0]);
           printf("The set is ");
           printValues(set , size);
           generateSubsets(set, size, 25);
           printf("Total Nodes generated %d
        ", total_nodes);
           return 0;
        }

<p>It uses the Brute force search to solve the problem, and the brute force search says that for the given problem, we try to make all the possible solutions and pick out the best solution from all the desired solutions.</p>
