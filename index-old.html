      <h1>Back Tracking</h1>

      <p><strong>Backtracking</strong> is the <b>form</b> of <em>recursion.</em></p>
      <p>Backtracking is a technique to solve dynamic programming problems. It works by going step by step and rejects those paths that do not lead to a solution and trackback (moves back ) to the previous position.</p>
      <p>In the subset sum problem, we have to find the subset of a set is such a way <ins>that</ins> the element of this subset-sum up to a <del>given</del> number K. All the elements of the set are positive and unique (no duplicate elements are present).</p>
